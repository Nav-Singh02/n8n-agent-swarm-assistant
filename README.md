# Agent Swarm Assistant (PoC) 🤖🧠

This project explores an **agent swarm architecture** built in **n8n**, focusing on orchestration patterns rather than end-to-end execution.

A central parent agent coordinates multiple specialized child agents, each responsible for exploring or applying task-specific tools. The workflow demonstrates how complex tasks can be decomposed, delegated, and reasoned over using modular AI agents.

---

## 🧩 Project Focus

- Parent / child agent orchestration
- Tool usage via specialized child agents
- Scalable, modular workflow design in n8n
- Exploration of agent collaboration patterns

This project is intentionally scoped as a **proof of concept** to highlight agent structure and workflow design rather than live integrations.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **n8n** for workflow orchestration
- **LLM-based agents** for reasoning and delegation
- **Agent routing & tool exploration** patterns

## 📁 Files Included

- `agent-swarm.json` – n8n workflow (PoC)
